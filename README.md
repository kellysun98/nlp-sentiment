## 1.0 Text Data Cleaning 
cleaning and preprocessing the restaurant review text database to extract

- the name of the restaurant
- the name of the dish

## 2.0 Semantic Analysis 

### 2.1 Topic Modeling

## 4.0 Recommendation system
We will implement BERT and GPT to generate recommendation repsectively, and compare their performance in terms of relevance and accuracy. 
GPT will also be used in Natural Language Explanation generation. 
### 4.1 Information Retrivial 


### 4.2 Recommendation Generation 
- use of BERT for fine-tuning a classification model to identify the dietary preferences of each customer based on their reviews.
-use of GPT to generate personalized dish recommendations based on the customer's preferences and past reviews.


### 4.3 Natural Language Explanation 
- use GPT to generate natural language explanations for each recommendation, providing additional information about the dish and why it's 
a good match for customer's preferences

## 5.0 Comparison
To compare the performance of the two models, a set of evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, 
and F1-score could be used to measure the accuracy of the recommendations generated by each model.
